Got it 👍 Here’s a **README.md** for your **Read Aloud Website Content Script** using Playwright + TTS:

# 🔊 Website Read Aloud Utility

This Python utility fetches the content of a webpage and **reads it aloud** using Text-to-Speech (TTS).  
It is built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) to reliably extract webpage text and [pyttsx3](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/) for offline speech synthesis.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetch any webpage text content using **Playwright**.
- Converts extracted text to **speech**.
- Works **offline** (no API calls needed).
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install playwright pyttsx3
playwright install
````

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone this repo or copy the script `readaloud.py`.
2. Run the script with a target URL:

   ```bash
   python readaloud.py
   ```

By default, the script reads a pre-set article.
To change the target page, update the `url` variable inside the script:

```python
url = "https://www.example.com/article"
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Playwright** launches a headless browser and navigates to the webpage.
2. The script extracts visible text content (`page.inner_text("body")`).
3. **pyttsx3** reads the text aloud in the system’s default voice.

---

## ✅ Example

```bash
python readaloud.py
```

🎧 Output: The script will start reading the article text aloud.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

* **TimeoutError on `page.goto`**
  Some websites block headless browsers.

  * Try adding a `user_agent` or use `wait_until="load"` instead of `"networkidle"`.
  * Example:

    ```python
    await page.goto(url, wait_until="load")
    ```

* **Voice too fast/slow?**
  Adjust the rate in the script:

  ```python
  engine.setProperty("rate", 160)
  ```

👉 Do you want me to also include a **Playwright-based fallback with gTTS** (Google TTS, better voice quality but needs internet), or keep it **offline only**?
